# Exercise 003: Send a Message to an Actor

In this exercise, we will send a message to our `CoffeeHouse`.

1. Run the `groom` command to initialize this exercise.
2. In `CoffeeHouseApp` send `CoffeeHouse` the *"Brew Coffee"* message.
3. Run the `test` command to verify the solution works as expected.
4. Run `CoffeeHouseApp` and verify:
    - *"CoffeeHouse Open"* is logged once.
    - *"Coffee Brewing"* is logged once.
5. Run the `next` command to advance to the next exercise.
