# Exercise 001: Implement an Actor

In this exercise, we will implement the `CoffeeHouse` actor with logging.

1. Run the `groom` command to initialize this exercise.
2. Create the `CoffeeHouse` actor in the `com.typesafe.training.coffeehouse` package as follows:
    - Mix-in the `Actor` and `ActorLogging` traits.
    - Define the initial behavior to handle any message by logging *"Coffee Brewing"* at `info`.
3. Run the `test` command to verify the solution works as expected.
4. Run the `CoffeeHouseApp` and verify that it boots up as expected.
5. Run the `next` command to advance to the next exercise.
