# [Optional] Exercise 021: Finite State Machine

In this exercise, we will replace our `become` and `stash` logic with FSM.

1. Run the `groom` command to initialize this exercise.
2. Re-factor `Barista`: Instead of the `become` based state matching, use `FSM`.
3. Re-factor `Guest`: Introduce an `FSM` based state machine.
4. Run the `test` command to verify the solution works as expected.
5. Run `CoffeeHouseApp` create some `Guest` actors and verify everything works as expected.

# Congratulations! You are Finished!
