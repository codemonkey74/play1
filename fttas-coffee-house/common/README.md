# Common Library

This is the `common` library used for all exercises. The first thing we want to do is verify this library is working properly.

1. Run the `test` command to verify the solution works as expected.
2. Run the `next` command to advance to the next exercise.
3. *HINT*: Remember, to always execute the `man` command for each exercise!
