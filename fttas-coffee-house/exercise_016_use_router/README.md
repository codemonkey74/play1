# Exercise 016: Use a Router

In this exercise, we will introduce parallelism through the use of routers.

1. Run the `groom` command to initialize this exercise.
2. Get rid of the bottleneck by using a router for the `Barista`.
3. Use an externally configured `round-robin` pool router.
4. Run the `test` command to verify the solution works as expected.
5. Run `CoffeeHouseApp` with different router configuration options and watch the throughput.
6. Run the `next` command to advance to the next exercise.
